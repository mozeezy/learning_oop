## Object-oriented Programming

- a style of programming that utilizes objects and classes rather than functions (i.e. procedural programming).
- each object has two main components: attributes (i.e. data describing the object such as name, color, age, etc...) and methods (functions that provide functionality to the data such as increase age, change color, title case name, etc...)

### Classes:

- These are the blueprints for which objects are based out of.
- In the class is where we define attributes and methods for each object.
- Think: Car class has attributes such as name, make, model and methods such as check speed, or drive forwards and backwards.

### Objects: 

- These are instances of classes.
- In our example of the Car class, think of a Toyota as an object of that class (i.e. instance).
- We can keep creating multiple instances of the Car class that operate independently from each other, making our code extremely modular.


### Visualizing Objects and Classes


Class Car -> "Honda", "Civic", 2000 ---- Instance 1
          -> "Toyota", "Corolla", 2004 ---- Instance 2
          -> "Dodge", "Charger", 2006 ----- Instance 3

- As you can see above, we were able to create 3 instances from the same class, each with their own independent sets of data
